Lightweight i18n for jQuery.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kostia/jquery.li18n.png)](https://travis-ci.org/kostia/jquery.li18n)

## Why?

* It does exactly what it promises: translation, interpolation, custom localization, locale fallback etc...
* It is lightweight: less than 100 LoC.
* Full test coverage.

## Other i18n libraries

The comments do not aim to be objective in any way, but reflect my own subjective opinions.

### Full-features heavyweights

* https://github.com/jquery/globalize Standard i18n lib by jQuery guys.
* https://github.com/airbnb/polyglot.js Feature list similar to `globalize`, but not specific to jQuery.

### Lightweights

* https://github.com/jamuhl/i18next Great i18n for jQuery, but does a little bit too much for my taste.
* https://github.com/recurser/jquery-i18n Similar to `i18next`, but the API is `HTMLElement` scentric.
* https://github.com/wikimedia/jquery.i18n Similar to `i18next`, unfortunately with some odd behaviour.
